            Ruia Fabrics, a legacy rooted in India's textile revolution since
            1952, traces its origins to the entrepreneurial spirit of Shri
            Shubankarji Ruia. From humble beginnings as a yarn merchant, the
            Ruia family's dedication and vision propelled them into the fabric
            trading arena as Ruia Brothers. Under the guidance of their esteemed
            father, they became pioneers, renowned for price competitiveness,
            quality, and diverse design range.

            With changing times, Ruia Brothers evolved, diversifying into
            manufacturing and integrating with weavers and mills to export
            superior quality fabrics. Madhusudan Ruia, one of Shri Shubhkarantji
            Ruiaâ€™s sons, founded Ruia Fabrics Pvt. Ltd. in 1990, marking the
            beginning of a new chapter. Certified by Grasim Industries in 2010,
            our collaboration with Aditya Birla Group's LIVA brand solidified
            our reputation for excellence in viscose fabrics.
